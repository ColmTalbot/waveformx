# waveformjax

Gravitational-wave waveform models for precessing compact binaries,
implemented in [JAX](https://github.com/jax-ml/jax). The models can be
compiled with `jax.jit`, evaluated for many binaries at once with
`jax.vmap`, and differentiated with respect to the binary's parameters with
`jax.grad`. They follow [LALSimulation](https://git.ligo.org/lscsoft/lalsuite)
and are checked against it.

The package has the same interface as the Python bindings of
[waveformrs](https://github.com/ColmTalbot/waveformrs).

## Models

- **IMRPhenomXPNR** (frequency domain): precessing spins with higher modes,
  tuned to numerical relativity. By default it includes the parity fix from
  the development version of LALSuite; the behaviour of the LALSimulation
  releases is available as an option. Its derivatives are computed in
  forward mode, so `jax.jvp` and `jax.jacfwd` work as well as `jax.grad`,
  and `jax.vmap` evaluates a batch of binaries together.
- **NRSur7dq4** (time domain): numerical-relativity surrogate for precessing
  binaries with higher modes. It gives LALSimulation's polarizations and
  modes, with the same length and start time; its pure function evaluates
  the waveform at any times and can be differentiated with respect to every
  parameter of the binary. It needs the surrogate data file from LALSuite's
  data repository.

## Features

- The waveformrs interface: polarizations, modes and batches of binaries,
  with LALSimulation's names, parameters and options.
- Pure JAX functions of a `Binary` for use inside your own `jit`, `vmap` and
  `grad` code.
- LALSimulation's conditioned waveforms and its conversions between the time
  and frequency domains (`SimInspiralTD` and `SimInspiralFD`):
  IMRPhenomXPNR in the time domain and NRSur7dq4 in the frequency domain,
  each also conditioned in its own domain, with LAL's tapers, high-pass
  filter, lengths and start times. They are also available as pure
  functions of the binary, which keep the length and start time of a
  reference binary and can be differentiated.

## Report

`report/` holds a technical report on how the models were implemented and
how they compare with LALSimulation and waveformrs, with the scripts that
make its measurements (`report/measure_all.sh`).
